Angular wrapper for SPServices jquery plugin

##Usage
This is a very basic example that will be updated in the coming months. Upload all the files to your
Documents folder in Sharepoint. The main file that you want to edit is test2_sp.htm (this will be updated too).

Make sure that all the links are correct for the inclusion files and then modify the list GUID that you want to query.
For my test, I created a custom list with two columns: one was a text column and the other was a "multiple lines of text"
with "rich HTML" - I am using Ofice365.
